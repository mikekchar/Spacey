** Metaphor

Spacey is a priority queue.  Facts can be pushed onto the priority queue.
The queue acts as an array of facts.  You can get a reference to the
first fact and the last fact.  You can also get a reference to the nth
fact by indexing the queue.  Finally, you can take an array of references
to facts to get a subset of the facts.

Facts in the priority queue are ordered by importance.  To understand the
importance, you must understand that the queue holds the facts in 3 separate
sets.  Items that have never been seen before are in the "new set".  Items
that need short term review are in the "working set".  Items that are
scheduled for long term review are in the "review set".
